# AlphaMove
Solution to 2020 CAD contest Problem B: Routing with Cell Movement

## Notice
Notice that our codes still have bugs, and we didn't implement optimization methods like partitioning or advanced routing algorithms.  Feel free to modify our program to create a new cell_move_router, but make sure you put your own creativity in it and remember to thank all the people that help created this work.

## Usage
Clone the repo and make to build the executable.
Linux (Ubuntu version 16.04 LTS):
```
make linux16
make
```
Linux (Ubuntu version 18.04 LTS or 20.04 LTS):
```
make linux18
make
```
macOS:
```
make mac
make
```
```
./cell_move_router <input.txt> <output.txt>
```
